### Origins
* Rasmus Lerdorf created "Personnel Home Page Tools" in 1994 (he wanted to check how many views his CV had).
* He released the source code in 1995 and rewrote it in 1996 and a number of times after that.
* Today PHP is a serverside scripting language or Hypertext Preprocessor.

### What can it do?
* It reads php scripts on the server side and then renders it into html which is sent to the client.
* PHP can provide output to images, PDF files and other formats.
* It can also talk to other services such as POP3 and IMAP.
* And works well with MySQL databasis.

### Nifty Things you can do with php:
* Write things to a text file
* Write things to pdf
* Make downloadable excel file
* Send SMS text messages

## Setup
### What do you need to make it work?
* You'll need a web-server (Apatche)
* and a database (MySQL)
* ...or you can install XAMPP which does it all for you.

### Installation tips:
* When you want write files using XAMPP you need to have admin wrights: sudo su ,
* and when to write files you need to change the folder and specific file permissions: chmod 777 fileName
