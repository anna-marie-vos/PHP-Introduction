# PHP
### PHP is like he-man... He can still save the world, even if he's a little old

### Why would you want to use it?
* ....Because of Web development job adverts like this:http://www.trademe.co.nz/jobs/it/programming-development/listing-1248292085.htm

### Origins
* Rasmus Lerdorf created "Personnel Home Page Tools" in 1994 (he wanted to check how many views his CV had).
* He released the source code in 1995 and rewrote it in 1996 and a number of times after that.
* Today PHP is a serverside scripting language and it now stands for Hypertext Preprocessor.

### What can it do?
* It reads php scripts on the server side and then renders it into html which is sent to the client.
* It renders dynamic pages. (but not 'react' dynamic)
* PHP can provide output to images, PDF files and other formats.
* It can also talk to other services such as POP3 and IMAP.
* And works well with MySQL databasis.

### Nifty Things you can do with php:
* Write things to a text file
* Write things to pdf
* Make downloadable excel file
* Send SMS text messages

### Seriously though:
* It is really easy to learn
* It's simplistic, with very few files needed to serve a web page connected to a database.
* It scales easily
* There are countless resources available
* Test driven development is supported.

## Setup
### What do you need to make it work?
* You'll need a web-server (Apatche)
* and a database (MySQL)
* ...or you can install XAMPP which does it all for you.

### Installation tips:
* When you want write files using XAMPP you need to have admin rights: sudo su ,
* and when to write files you need to change the folder and specific file permissions: chmod 777 fileName
